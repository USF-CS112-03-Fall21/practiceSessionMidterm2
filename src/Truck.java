 * Consider classes Vehicle and Truck.
 * Fill in code in class Truck so that:

  - it is a child class of Vehicle,
  - calls constructor of the parent from its own constructor and
  - overrides the print method to print the number of doors, the number of seats and whether it's a pickup truck or not.

 You may use VehicleDriver class to test your code.
